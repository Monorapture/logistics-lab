# 🏗️ Data Engineering Gym & Logistics Lab

> **Status:** 🚧 Active Training Ground

## 🎯 Mission
This repository serves as my personal **training ground** to build muscle memory and test new concepts.
Unlike my portfolio projects, the code here is experimental. The goal is continuous repetition and "getting the reps in" to maintain proficiency in Python and SQL.

**Core Objectives:**
* Prevent skill decay ("Don't get rusty").
* Test isolated logic before implementing it in production.
* Practice Git workflows (Branching, Merging).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Focus Areas
* **Python:** `pandas`, `pathlib`, `sqlite3`
* **SQL:** CTEs, Window Functions, Aggregations
* **Architecture:** ELT Patterns, Clean Code Principles

## 📂 Repository Structure
* `daily_drills/`: Quick coding exercises and syntax refreshers.
* `mini_projects/`: Small, isolated scenarios (e.g., Supply Chain Simulations).
* `experiments/`: Testing new libraries or "first principles" logic.

*Note: This code is for educational purposes and rapid prototyping. For production-ready code examples, please see my [Portfolio Repositories].*
