# 🏗️ Data Engineering Gym & Logistics Lab

> **Status:** 🚧 Active Training Ground

## 🎯 Mission
This repository serves as my personal **training ground** to build muscle memory and test new concepts.
Unlike my portfolio projects, the code here is experimental. The goal is continuous repetition and "getting the reps in" to maintain proficiency in Python and SQL.

**Core Objectives:**
* Prevent skill decay ("Don't get rusty").
* Test isolated logic before implementing it in production.
* Practice Git workflows (Branching, Merging).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Focus Areas
* **Python:** `pandas`, `pathlib`, `sqlite3`
* **SQL:** CTEs, Window Functions, Aggregations
* **Architecture:** ELT Patterns, Clean Code Principles

## 📂 Repository Structure
* `daily_drills/`: Quick coding exercises and syntax refreshers.
* `mini_projects/`: Small, isolated scenarios (e.g., Supply Chain Simulations).
* `experiments/`: Testing new libraries or "first principles" logic.

### 🚀 Featured Projects

| Project | Domain | Description | Stack |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[Inventory SQL Pipeline](https://github.com/Monorapture/inventory-sql-pipeline)** | **Analytics Engineering** | A modular ELT architecture acting as the "Single Source of Truth". Calculates stock levels, detects "Zombie Data", and strictly separates cleaning logic from business reporting. | `SQL` `Pandas` |
| **[Logistics Python Tools](https://github.com/Monorapture/logistics-python-tools)** | **End-to-End Analytics** | A mono-repo containing my core tools: The **SDR Liability Calculator** (API-based), the **Data Cleaning Pipeline**, and the **Supply Chain Control Tower** (Dashboard). | `Python` `Streamlit` |
| **[Analyst Toolkit Library](https://github.com/Monorapture/logistics-data-utils)** | **Python Library** | My open-source utility library. Follows the **DRY principle** to standardize Excel formatting, database connections, and path handling across all my projects. | `Python` `Automation` |
